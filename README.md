Fork info:
This fork implements generating video thumbnails.

Inspired by this fork https://github.com/cody82/filebrowser/tree/videopreview
and further customized.

customaizations include:
* Generation into a .thumbnails subfolder with files in addition to cache mechanism.
* Intel hardware QSV acceleration.
* Thumbnails will stop generating when leaving a folder to allow generating for the next folder before finishing the last one.

** Obvoisly requires ffmpeg, an intel card + drivers.

** Uses the ctx utility to impelent the feature of stoppeing generation, so probably not compatible with windows.

Modified files are:

/http/preview.go

/src/components/files/ListingItem.vue

ChadGPT havevily used in generating the code.

Although I have some programming skills and even a software engeneering degree, my career path led me to IT and System Administration.
This is basically my first experience with golang, so don't be harsh.
